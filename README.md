This smart contract was built to help people create charity smart contracts and contribute to the community.
The idea of this smart contract is to create a charity contract manager to run multiple decentralized charity campaigns

The first version (the one submitted on 10/06/2022) is made without upgrade functionalities, and with some vulnerabilities related to DOS.

I am sorry ... I just didn't get time to fix them. However, the next version will be more secure with a bunch of security mechanisms in place.

So use this smart contract with extreme caution.

also, you may find some spelling errors in my comments so just forget about them. they were written without too much care.

I hope that you like this smart contract, and please do not hesitate to contact me for any further information
